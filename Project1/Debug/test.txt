Worldwide, as millions of people stay at home to minimise transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, health-care workers prepare to do the exact opposite. They will go to clinics and hospitals, putting themselves at high risk from COVID-2019. Figures from China's National Health Commission show that more than 3300 health-care workers have been infected as of early March and, according to local media, by the end of February at least 22 had died. In Italy, 20% of responding health-care workers were infected, and some have died. Reports from medical staff describe physical and mental exhaustion, the torment of difficult triage decisions, and the pain of losing patients and colleagues, all in addition to the infection risk.
As the pandemic accelerates, access to personal protective equipment (PPE) for health workers is a key concern. Medical staff are prioritised in many countries, but PPE shortages have been described in the most affected facilities. Some medical staff are waiting for equipment while already seeing patients who may be infected or are supplied with equipment that might not meet requirements. Alongside concerns for their personal safety, health-care workers are anxious about passing the infection to their families. Health-care workers who care for elderly parents or young children will be drastically affected by school closures, social distancing policies, and disruption in the availability of food and other essentials.
Health-care systems globally could be operating at more than maximum capacity for many months. But health-care workers, unlike ventilators or wards, cannot be urgently manufactured or run at 100% occupancy for long periods. It is vital that governments see workers not simply as pawns to be deployed, but as human individuals. In the global response, the safety of health-care workers must be ensured. Adequate provision of PPE is just the first step; other practical measures must be considered, including cancelling non-essential events to prioritise resources; provision of food, rest, and family support; and psychological support. Presently, health-care workers are every country's most valuable resource.

Summary
Background
We aimed to evaluate and improve the accuracy of the ultrasound scan in estimating gestational age in late pregnancy (ie, after 24 weeks' gestation) in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), where access to ultrasound in the first half of pregnancy is rare and where intrauterine growth restriction is prevalent.
Methods
This prospective, population-based, cohort study was done in three LMICs (Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Tanzania) participating in the WHO Alliance for Maternal and Newborn Health Improvement study. Women carrying a live singleton fetus dated by crown-rump length (CRL) measurements between 8+0–14+6 weeks of gestation, who were willing to return for two additional ultrasound scans, and who planned on delivering in the study area were enrolled in the study. Participants underwent ultrasonography at 24+0–29+6 weeks and at 30+0–36+6 weeks' gestation. Birthweights were measured within 72 h of birth, and the proportions of infants who had a small-for-gestational-age birthweight (ie, a birthweight <10% of the standard birthweight for the infant's gestational age and sex according to the INTERGROWTH-21st project newborn baby reference standards) and appropriate-for-gestational-age birthweights were ascertained. Estimation of gestational age by standard fetal biometry measurements in addition to transcerebellar diameter (TCD) measurements was compared with gold-standard CRL measurements by use of Bland-Altman plots to calculate the mean difference and 95% limits of agreement. Statistical modelling was done to develop new gestational age prediction formulas for third trimester ultrasonography in LMICs.
Findings
Between Feb 7, 2015, and Jan 9, 2017, 1947 women were enrolled in the study. 1387 pregnant women had an ultrasound scan at 24+0–29+6 weeks of gestation and 1403 had an ultrasound scan between 30+0–36+6 weeks of gestation. Of the 1379 unique infants whose birthweights were available, 981 (71·1%) infants were born with an appropriate-for-gestational-age birthweight and 398 (28·9%) infants were born with a small-for-gestational-age birthweight. The accuracy of late pregnancy ultrasound biometry using existing formulas to estimate gestational age in LMICs was similar to that in high-income settings. With standard dating formulas, late pregnancy ultrasound at 24+0–29+6 weeks' gestation was accurate to within approximately plus or minus 2 weeks of the gold-standard CRL measurement of gestational age, and late pregnancy ultrasound was accurate to within ±3 weeks of the CRL measurement at 30+0–36+6 weeks' gestation. In infants who were ultimately born small for gestational age, individual parameters systematically underestimated gestational age, apart from TCD, which showed minimal bias. By use of a novel parsimonious model formula that combined TCD with femur length, gestational age at the 24+0 −29+6-week ultrasound scan was estimated to within ±10·5 days of the CRL measurement and estimated to within ±15·1 days of the CRL measurement at the 30+0–36+6-week ultrasound scan. Similar results were observed in infants who were small-for-gestational-age.
Interpretation
Incorporation of TCD and the use of new formulas in late pregnancy ultrasound scans could improve the accuracy of gestational age estimation in both appropriate-for-gestational-age and small-for-gestational-age infants in LMICs. Given the high rates of small-for-gestational-age infants in LMICs, these results might be especially relevant. Validation of this new formula in other LMIC populations is needed to establish whether the accuracy of the late pregnancy ultrasound can be narrowed to within approximately 2 weeks.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
The performance of late pregnancy ultrasound for assessing gestational age has been understudied in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), where access to ultrasound for gestational age dating early in pregnancy is rare and where a high proportion of infants are born small-for-gestational age. In high-income settings, the transcerebellar diameter (TCD) has shown promise as a biometric parameter that is less affected by intrauterine growth restriction than standard ultrasound biometric measurements, but this parameter is not routinely used, as most women in high-income settings present earlier (<20 weeks of gestation) for ultrasound confirmation of gestational age.
Added value of this study
In this multicountry, population-based, cohort study, we compared the performance of standard ultrasound biometric parameters and TCD with the gold-standard method of first trimester crown-rump length (CRL) measurements for estimating gestational age in late pregnancy (ie, after 24 weeks' gestation). The accuracy of ultrasonography in estimating gestational age in late pregnancy in LMICs was similar to that reported in high-income settings, but it was further improved when TCD was included in the combination formulas for gestational age assessment. We derived a parsimonious model, requiring measurement of only the TCD and the femur length, that was accurate to within approximately plus or minus 2 weeks of the gold-standard CRL measurement of gestational age, even among infants who were ultimately born small-for-gestational-age. Our study was population-based, enrolling an unselected group of pregnant women rather than a selected group of only the healthiest pregnant women; therefore, we believe our novel gestational age formula is more generalisable to real-world conditions that health-care practitioners in LMICs face.
Implications of all the available evidence
In LMICs, gestational age in late pregnancy can be reliably assessed to within approximately ±2 weeks of the CRL measurement by use of only two ultrasound parameters. These results were consistent when our gestational age formulas were applied to pregnancies in which the infants were ultimately born small for gestational age. Our formulas could be most useful when measuring gestational age in pregnant women who present late to receive antenatal care in LMICs, where the burden of intrauterine growth restriction is high. The biometric ultrasound measurements used in our study appear to be attainable by health-care providers with limited sonography training. Accurate gestational age dating can enable providers to identify pregnancies requiring antenatal interventions, such as corticosteroids or transfer to a facility that is able to handle premature infants. Accurate dating will also allow researchers to better estimate the global burden of preterm birth and intrauterine growth restriction.
Introduction
Pregnancy dating is an essential component of antenatal care. Accurate estimation of gestational age is needed to optimise provision of obstetric interventions and delivery location for preterm births, and it is also a prerequisite to identify and manage fetal growth abnormalities. Additionally, accurate estimation of gestational age is required to provide reasonable global estimates of preterm birth and intrauterine growth restriction.
In low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), where the burden of preterm birth and intrauterine growth restriction is highest,1,  2 assessing gestational age accurately can be challenging because of many factors. For instance, last menstrual period is often unknown, and menstrual cycles can vary in length.3,  4 Symphysis fundal height can be a misleading measure of gestational age because of variation in maternal adiposity, intrauterine growth restriction, uterine fibroids, or malpresentation. The first trimester ultrasound is considered to be the gold-standard method for estimating gestational age in high-income settings,5 but ultrasound early in gestation might not be routinely available in LMICs. In addition, pregnant women in LMICs might not present for antenatal care in early pregnancy. As gestation advances, ultrasound biometry becomes less accurate for estimating gestational age, given the emergence of natural variation in fetal size and the possibility of pathological growth restriction. Indeed, in LMICs, where 19·3% of infants are born small-for-gestational-age,6 the assumption that fetal size predicts gestational age might not be valid.
Studies7,  8 suggest that measurements of the cerebellum could allow for a more accurate estimation of gestational age late in pregnancy (ie, from 24 weeks' gestation onwards) compared with standard biometry measurements. Cerebellar size appears to be less affected by intrauterine growth restriction than other measures of growth.9 There is also less natural variation in cerebellar size between fetuses. Transcerebellar diameter (TCD) nomograms have been published for several populations,7 but they are not in mainstream use in high-income settings, as most women have early ultrasound scans (at <20 weeks' gestation) when standard biometric measurements (biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length) are reported to provide an accurate estimation of gestational age (to within plus or minus 1–2 weeks of the gold-standard crown-rump length (CRL) measurement of gestational age).10 Standard biometry does not perform as well in the third trimester as it does at less than 20 weeks' gestation, with a reported accuracy of only ±3 or more weeks of the CRL measurement.11 One study in the USA9 found a strong correlation between cerebellar size and gestational age in infants born with an appropriate-for-gestational-age birthweight and in those born small-for-gestational-age. Even though a small number of studies12,  13 have measured the cerebellum in specific LMICs, the performance of cerebellar biometry for assessing gestational age has been understudied in settings where its use might be of greater benefit.
The objective of the WHO Alliance for Maternal and Newborn Health Improvement (AMANHI) late pregnancy dating study was to evaluate the accuracy of late pregnancy (ie, after 24 weeks' gestation) ultrasound biometry in estimating gestational age in LMIC settings, with a particular focus on the effect of intrauterine growth restriction on the accuracy and whether cerebellar measurements could improve performance.
Methods
 Study design and participants
The WHO AMANHI study cohort was established in 2010 to harmonise several large ongoing maternal and neonatal health research studies in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia.14 The study involved five distinct sites (Sylhet, Bangladesh; Karachi, Pakistan; Pemba, Tanzania; Brong Ahafo, Gahna; Southern Province, Zambia). Three of the five AMANHI sites (Sylhet, Karachi, and Pemba) participated in this prospective, multicountry, population-based cohort substudy, known as the WHO AMANHI late pregnancy dating study. The remaining two sites (Brong Ahafo and the Southern Province) were ineligible, having completed AMANHI enrolment. AMANHI study populations were predominantly rural with low levels of literacy. As AMANHI was an unselected, population-based cohort, it was inclusive of both appropriately grown and growth-restricted infants.
Between Feb 7, 2015, and Jan 9, 2017, pregnant women were identified by trained field workers through home visits. Urine tests for human chorionic gonadotropin were used to confirm pregnancies. Women were eligible for the study if they were pregnant with a live singleton fetus, the pregnancy had been dated by CRL measurements between 8+0 and 14+0 weeks' gestation (CRL of <95 mm),15 they were willing to return for two additional ultrasounds, and they planned on delivering in the study area. Women pregnant with multiple fetuses, or a non-viable or anomalous fetus were ineligible. Fieldworkers obtained written informed consent from participants in their local languages and arranged study ultrasounds to coincide with standard AMANHI visits.
Ethics approval was granted by institutional review boards and ethics review committees in the participating countries, the host institutions of principal investigators, WHO, and Partners HealthCare (the Boston-based coordinating team).
 Procedures
We considered the first trimester ultrasound scan to be the gold-standard method for estimating gestational age. AMANHI study sonographers followed standardised procedures to obtain high-quality transabdominal CRL measurements. Three CRL measurements were obtained for each participant, and the median CRL value and the INTERGROWTH-21st equation15 were used to calculate gestational age. First trimester CRL measurements established the estimated date of delivery and were considered as the gold standard gestational age at all subsequent study visits.
Study ultrasound procedures were standardised during a 4-day training course in Bangladesh for staff from participating AMANHI sites, and consisted of didactic and practical teaching methods.16 Competency was assessed with written and practical post-training assessments. Staff from Pakistan were unable to attend because of visa issues and they were therefore trained via Skype conferencing. No additional sonographers were recruited during the study period.
Two ultrasound scans subsequent to the first trimester ultrasound were done for each participant: the first, between 24+0 and 28+6 weeks' gestation, and the second, between 32+0 and 36+6 weeks' gestation, both coinciding with routine AMANHI visits. After study initiation, the gestational age windows were extended to 24+0–29+6 weeks and 30+0–36+0 weeks to cover a wider range of the third trimester; however, only the Pemba site received ethics approval for this extension before study completion. At every ultrasound visit, sonographers followed standardised procedures to obtain high-quality measurements of the biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, femur length, and TCD (appendix p 4).
Sonographers were masked to the gold-standard gestational age established by CRL measurements. Ultrasound biometry measurements were obtained without the use of an automated biometry software package, so that only absolute measurements were taken. Two measurements for each biometric parameter were obtained and averaged. Plausible measurement ranges were defined for each parameter before the analysis (CRL 2·0–95·0 mm; biparietal diameter 3·0–11·0 cm; head circumference 10·0–40·0 cm; femur length 2·0–9·0 cm; abdominal circumference 12·0–42·0 cm; and TCD 1·5–6·0 cm). For measures outside of these ranges, data were checked for data entry errors and were assigned as missing if unresolved. Gestational age was calculated from each individual biometric parameter by use of standard tables (Hadlock and colleagues17 for biparietal diameter, femur length, and abdominal circumference; Chavez and colleagues18 for TCD; and INTERGROWTH-21st project19 for head circumference). Gestational age was also calculated by use of previously published formulas that combine more than one parameter (Hadlock and colleagues17 and INTERGROWTH-21st project19). Formulas and the reasonable ranges for individual parameters are detailed in the appendix (p 2).
An image quality checklist provided objective guidance on appropriate image magnification, ideal image plane, and correct calliper placement. All study images were reviewed by BJW, who was masked to the gold-standard gestational age values, for ongoing quality control with quarterly feedback to the sonographers.
Infants were visited within 72 h of birth. Birthweights were obtained by use of digital scales. Small-for-gestational-age was defined as less than 10% of the standard birthweight for the infant's gestational age and sex according to the INTERGROWTH-21st project newborn baby reference standards.20,  21
 Statistical analysis
Study sample size was calculated on the basis of our hypothesis that the gestational age agreement between TCD and CRL would be higher than the agreement between standard biometry and CRL, both among infants with appropriate-for-gestational-age birthweights and among those with small-for-gestational-age birthweights. Previously published literature11 and professional society guidelines5 have shown that late pregnancy biometry combination formulas have a gestational age accuracy of within ±21–30 days of the gold-standard first trimester CRL measurements. By use of overlapping Bland-Altman plots to compare the degree of agreement between TCD versus CRL with standard biometry versus CRL, a sample size of 50 would be adequate to show a mean difference of 0 and 95% limits of agreement (LOA) of within 10 days (TCD vs CRL) versus within 21 days (standard biometry vs CRL) of the CRL-estimated gestational age. We aimed to enrol a minimum of 50 infants with small-for-gestational-age birthweights per site.22,  23 Assuming that 20% of infants would be small-for-gestational-age and that 25% of pregnant women would be lost to follow-up at delivery, we required 333 infants per site; therefore, we had a conservative target of enrolling 400 participants per study site.
The Stata software programme (StataCorp, Stata Statistical Software: Release 14.1; College Station, TX, USA) was used for all statistical analyses. Bland-Altman plots were used to assess the agreement between gestational age measured by gold-standard CRL and gestational age measured by late pregnancy ultrasound biometric parameters.24 Mean differences (bias) with 95% CIs and 95% LOA values were calculated for each comparison. For ease of comparison, an approximation of the degree of agreement was calculated as the midpoint between the unsigned LOA values. As an example, if the 95% LOA was −20 to +22 days, the approximation of agreement would be within ±21 days of the gestational age, as determined by the gold-standard first trimester CRL measurement. For individual biometric parameters or combinations of parameters with bias (ie, if the 95% CI of the mean difference does not include 0), the gestational age window agreement limits would be skewed in the direction of the bias.
For infants with available birthweights, we stratified the results by infant size to compare the accuracy of late pregnancy biometry measures among infants with appropriate-for-gestational-age birthweights and small-for-gestational-age birthweights.
Statistical modelling was used to develop novel equations to predict gestational age with late pregnancy biometric parameters as covariates. Generalised linear regression was done by use of the Stata glm command, accounting for clustering of multiple visits for a participant. Gold-standard gestational age determination by CRL measurement was the dependent variable. Covariates tested in the models included all late pregnancy biometric parameters measured (biparietal diameter, head circumference, femur length, abdominal circumference, and TCD). Natural logarithms were used to transform continuous measures given non-normal distributions. Models with individual and combinations of biometric parameters were tested. Given the performance of TCD as an individual parameter, models including TCD as the main predictor were examined, adding additional biometric parameters, assessing for significance (ie, if the p value was <0·05) and improvement in the adjusted R2, and determining the best-fit model according to the Akaike Information Criterion.
Potential models were cross-validated to compare the predictive accuracy of the different models and select biometric parameters to be included in the final model. Two methods were used to cross-validate the models. In the first method, the study dataset was divided into five random subsamples, one subsample was withheld, and statistical models were generated with the remaining 80% of the data. The model was then used to predict gestational age in the withheld 20% subsample, and a standardised error term was calculated on the basis of the predicted gestational age, calculated as: (observed gestational age – predicted gestational age)2/(predicted gestational age). This process was repeated with each successive withheld subsample, and a summary measure of the prediction error was generated for the entire dataset. The model with the lowest prediction error was selected as the final model. In the second cross-validation method, the data from one study site were withheld, and statistical models were generated with data from the remaining two sites. The model was then fit and used to predict gestational age in the first site that had the data withheld. This process was repeated twice and the standardised error was calculated.

Results
Between Feb 7, 2015, and Jan 9, 2017, 1947 pregnant women in three of the five AMANHI study sites (Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Tanzania) with documented CRL assessments between 8+0 and 14+0 weeks' gestation were enrolled in this late pregnancy ultrasound study. Of these women, 1619 completed late pregnancy scans. Data from nine infants were excluded from the final analysis because of implausible dates that could not be reconciled (eg, date of birth before date of ultrasound, or year of ultrasound or birth recorded incorrectly). We determined a priori that a difference of greater than 60 days between the gold-standard CRL measurement of gestational age and the gestational age predicted by late pregnancy biometry measurements was considered to be implausibly associated with the performance of the ultrasound. Three such extreme outliers were excluded at 24+0–29+6 weeks' gestation, and an additional three were excluded at 30+0–36+6 weeks' gestation. The final analysis included 1611 unique mothers, of whom 1387 underwent an ultrasound scan between 24+0 and 29+6 weeks' gestation (546 in Bangladesh, 456 in Pakistan, and 385 in Tanzania), and 1403 underwent an ultrasound scan between 30+0 and 36+6 weeks' gestation (531 in Bangladesh, 449 in Pakistan, and 423 in Tanzania; figure 1).

More than 97% of all attempts at biometric measurements were successful. Of the 1387 ultrasound scans done at 24+0–29+6 weeks' gestation, values for the biparietal diameter were missing in two (0·1%) scans, for head circumference in three (0·2%) scans, for femur length in two (0·1%) scans, for abdominal circumference in three (0·2%) scans, and for TCD in three (0·2%) scans. Of the 1403 ultrasound scans done at 30+0–36+6 weeks' gestation, missing values for the different parameters were similar to the ultrasound scan at 24+0–29+6 weeks' gestation, with two (0·1%) values missing for biparietal diameter, two (0·1%) for head circumference, none for femur length, and eight (0·6%) for abdominal circumference. Even at 30+0–36+6 weeks' gestation, TCD measurements were successfully obtained from 1365 (97%) of 1403 ultrasound scans. Summary measures from the individual biometric parameters (mean and SD) for the cohort and by site are included in the appendix (p 1). Using the reference nomogram for CRL by Hadlock and colleagues17 as an alternative to the INTERGROWTH-21st project19 nomogram, no significant differences in the distribution of gestational ages estimated from either third trimester ultrasound scan were observed (data not shown).
From the ultrasound scans done at 24+0–29+6 weeks' gestation, the performance of individual biometric parameters showed fairly similar agreement with gold-standard CRL measurements (approximations ranging from ±12·8 to ±16·2 days of the standard CRL measurements; table 1). There was little bias, as evidenced by a mean difference close to zero for all parameters. A representative Bland-Altman plot for TCD versus CRL is presented in figure 2.

From the ultrasound scans done at 30+0–36+6 weeks' gestation, TCD had narrower 95% LOA than the other individual biometric parameters (table 1). The agreement between TCD and gold-standard CRL measurements was approximated to be within ±17·4 days of the CRL measurement with little bias (mean difference 1·5 days, 95% CI 1·0–2·0). Compared with TCD, the remaining individual parameters showed less agreement with CRL measurements (approximations ranged between ±19·8–25·2 days). A strong negative bias for biparietal diameter (–8·0 days, 95% CI −8·6 to −7·4), femur length (–7·7 days, −8·2 to −7·2), and abdominal circumference (–4·8 days, −5·4 to −4·1) was observed, suggesting a systematic underestimation of gestational age by approximately 1 week.
From the ultrasound scan at 24+0–29+6 weeks' gestation, the Hadlock17 and INTERGROWTH-21st project19 combination formulas outperformed individual parameters by a few days (approximations ranged between ±11·1–11·9 days) and maintained little bias (table 1). From the ultrasound scan at 30+0–36+6 weeks' gestation, TCD alone (approximation ±17·4 days) showed a similar degree of agreement to CRL measurements as the Hadlock17 formula (approximation ±18·0 days), and slightly narrower agreement with CRL measurements than the INTERGROWTH-21st project19 formula (approximation 19·8 days). Notably, the Hadlock17 formula had a strong negative bias (mean difference −7·7 days, 95% CI −8·1 to −7·2). Results did not vary substantially by site (data not shown) and have been presented together.
Stratification of results by infant size was done in women who were less than 42 weeks pregnant when they gave birth with birthweights available, and included 1186 (86%) of 1387 women who had an ultrasound scan at 24+0–29+6 weeks' gestation, 1236 (88%) of 1403 women who had an ultrasound scan at 30+0–36+6 weeks' gestation, and 1379 (86%) of all 1611 unique infants for whom the birthweights were known. 398 (29%) of the 1379 unique infants were classified as small-for-gestational-age. The prevalence of infants who were small-for-gestational-age varied by site and was higher in Asian sites (234 [44%] of 526 infants in Bangladesh and 122 [28%] of 430 infants in Pakistan) than in the African sites (42 [10%] of 423 infants in Tanzania).
TCD outperformed the other biometric parameters in predicting gestational age and showed less negative bias (ie, less underestimation), with 95% LOA values that were similar at the 24+0–29+6-week and 30+0–36+6-week scans in infants who had appropriate-for-gestational age birthweights and small-for-gestational-age birthweights (table 2). Hadlock17 and INTERGROWTH-21st project19 combination formulas had slightly narrower 95% LOA values than individual parameters at the 24+0–29+6-week scan in infants who were small-for-gestational-age (table 2), although the Hadlock17 formula had substantial negative bias (–5·7 days, 95% CI −6·2 to −5·2). At the 30+0–36+6-week scan, TCD had a similar 95% LOA to the combination formulas for infants who were small-for-gestational-age (approximation 15·8 days) but with less bias (mean difference 0·3 days) than both the Hadlock17 (–13·2 days) and INTERGROWTH-21st project19 formulas (–4·2 days; table 2).

The four statistical models generated from the AMANHI late pregnancy dating study are shown in table 3. Model 1 was the most accurate in predicting gestational age and included four biometric parameters. Model 2 included only TCD and femur length and showed the least prediction error among the three more parsimonious models (combining only two parameters) after both cross-validation approaches were applied (appendix p 3).

The final model was fit by including TCD and femur length in a regression with the entire dataset (model 2, table 3; formula in appendix p 3). The prediction error (appendix p 3) is on the final model involving the entire cohort data. Formulas for all candidate models and their out-of-model prediction errors are shown in the appendix (p 3).
From the ultrasound scan at 24+0–29+6 weeks' gestation, our novel AMANHI combination formula, combining TCD and femur length measurements, showed little improvement in the accuracy of estimating gestational age when infants were stratified by birthweight (appropriate-for-gestational-age or small-for-gestational-age) compared with previous combination formulas,17,  19 improving estimations by only 1 day (table 2). However, from the ultrasound scan at 30+0–36+6 weeks' gestation, the AMANHI combination formula could more accurately predict gestational age for appropriate-for-gestational-age infants and small-for-gestational-age infants compared with the INTERGROWTH-21st project19 combination formula, narrowing the 95% LOA to approximately ±2 weeks and with minimal bias (table 2).
Discussion
We have identified several key findings regarding the performance of ultrasound biometry in late pregnancy in a large cohort of pregnant women in three LMIC settings. First, it was reassuring to verify that the accuracy of late pregnancy ultrasound for estimating gestational age in our study was similar to the reported results from higher-income settings, where sonographer training is lengthier and includes more practical training compared with sonographer training in LMIC settings. Biometric parameters at 24+0–29+6 weeks' gestation and 30+0–36+6 weeks' gestation, alone and in combination, were accurate to within approximately ±3·0–3·5 weeks of the gold-standard CRL measurement of gestational age. These results are consistent with previous reports of the performance of late pregnancy biometric parameters.22,  23,  24
In our study, the accuracy of gestational age dating with individual biometric parameters before 30 weeks was reasonably good (approximation ±12·8 days to ±16·2 days of the standard CRL measurements), improving even further (approximation ±11·1–11·9 days) when individual biometric parameters were combined according to previously published formulas. Later scans (>30 weeks) had wider individual 95% LOAs (approximation ±17·4–25·2 days). As hypothesised, the TCD, as a single biometric parameter, had the narrowest 95% LOA (approximation ±17·4 days), and even outperformed the combination formulas slightly (approximation ±18·0–19·8 days). Importantly, TCD also performed quite well among infants who were ultimately born small-for-gestational-age with an accuracy of approximately ±11·8 days of the CRL measurement of gestational age at 24+0–29+6 weeks and approximately ±15·8 days of the CRL measurement at 30+0–36+6 weeks, with little bias (mean difference of 0·3 days at both gestational age windows). In summary, nomograms established for measuring cerebellar size in high-resource settings appear to perform well in this LMIC population.
Given the initial results showing successful performance of TCD in estimating gestational age, we combined TCD with standard biometric parameters and used statistical modelling to investigate the performance of different combination formulas in the LMIC study sites, where the prevalence of infants born small-for-gestational-age is high. Our first model, combining TCD with biparietal diameter, femur length, and abdominal circumference, narrowed the 95% LOA across the two third trimester gestational age windows to less than 2 weeks. A second parsimonious model, combining only TCD and femur length, performed nearly as well as the first model, with the added benefit of simplicity in the number of parameters included. Both the femur and the cerebellum are structures that are fairly easy to identify. In addition, the measurements of these parameters are linear, and therefore require less skill in calliper placement than circumference measurements, as evidenced by the observation that these measurements were obtained successfully in 97% of ultrasound scans in our study. When compared with other published combination formulas, our AMANHI parsimonious model formula had the narrowest 95% LOA, the least bias, and performed similarly among infants born appropriate for gestational age and small for gestational age in both gestational age windows. As the AMANHI formulas were derived from our study population, it is not surprising that they performed well, even after attempting to separate model development and validation through cross-validation exercises. Our gestational age formulas should therefore be viewed as hypothesis-generating, and they should be validated in other LMIC populations before they are used extensively.
It is important to emphasise that our study included an unselected and population-based cohort from three LMICs at the time of enrolment. The cohort therefore reflects the range of morbidities associated with pregnancy, maternal nutritional status, and fetal sizes that would be encountered by a health-care practitioner in similar settings. Our cohort contrasts those used in previous studies,19,  20,  21 such as the INTERGROWTH-21st project19 cohort, that were designed to measure optimal fetal growth and enrolled only healthy low-risk women who were less likely to carry a growth-restricted fetus. These differences might help to explain why our AMANHI parsimonious model outperformed both the Hadlock17 and INTERGROWTH-21st project19 formulas among infants who were born small for gestational age. Even at 30+0–36+6 weeks' gestation, the 95% LOA of our AMANHI parsimonious formula was still within ±15 days of the CRL measurement of gestational age, and it performed similarly among infants born with small-for-gestational-age (approximation ±13·0 days) or appropriate-for-gestational-age (approximation ±15·3 days) birthweights. An estimation of gestational age to within approximately ±2 weeks of the standard CRL measurement is a remarkable achievement for LMIC settings, as many women do not have an ultrasonography in the first half of pregnancy. If intrauterine growth restriction is suspected, measurement of cerebellar size in the third trimester could help to confirm that this is the case.
Our study has several strengths, including its large sample size and the determination of gestational age by use of gold-standard first trimester CRL measurements that were verified by a multilayered quality control process. Nonetheless, there are some limitations of our study. We did not evaluate the feasibility of obtaining cerebellum measurements after 36 weeks' gestation. With advancing gestation, shadowing from the calcified skull might preclude the accurate measurement of the TCD margins, limiting its use as the pregnancy nears full term. The results shown in figure 2 suggest that accurate TCD measurements might be more difficult to obtain as the pregnancy advances, as several individual data points fell below the lower 95% LOA rather than the upper LOA at the 30+0–36+6-week gestational age window. This underestimation of gestational age by TCD in this gestational age window could reflect difficulties in measuring the full size of the cerebellar hemispheres.
In summary, if validated in other LMIC populations, our novel parsimonious model for estimating gestational age in late pregnancy could be useful for research, public health surveillance, and clinical care. Our study findings might be clinically relevant for health-care providers tasked with determining whether a fetus is small rather than preterm, and thus might limit iatrogenic harm from unnecessary preterm delivery.
Two important messages can be concluded from our work. First, cerebellar measurements using previously established nomograms from high-resource settings are a useful adjunct to late pregnancy biometry measurements in LMICs, where the burden of infants born small-for-gestational-age is high. Secondly, if validated in other LMIC populations, a parsimonious gestational age formula requiring measurement of only two biometric parameters might narrow accuracy of late pregnancy ultrasound to within approximately 2 weeks.

precisely and accurately track user motions, MotionTracking technology can convert handsets and tablets
into powerful 3D intelligent devices that can be used in applications ranging from health and fitness
monitoring to location-based services. Key requirements for MotionInterface enabled devices are small
package size, low power consumption, high accuracy and repeatability, high shock tolerance, and application
specific performance programmability – all at a low consumer price point.
The MPU-60X0 is the world’s first integrated 6-axis MotionTracking device that combines a 3-axis
gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, and a Digital Motion Processor™ (DMP) all in a small 4x4x0.9mm
package. With its dedicated I 2 C sensor bus, it directly accepts inputs from an external 3-axis compass to
provide a complete 9-axis MotionFusion™ output. The MPU-60X0 MotionTracking device, with its 6-axis
integration, on-board MotionFusion™, and run-time calibration firmware, enables manufacturers to eliminate
the costly and complex selection, qualification, and system level integration of discrete devices, guaranteeing
optimal motion performance for consumers. The MPU-60X0 is also designed to interface with multiple non-
inertial digital sensors, such as pressure sensors, on its auxiliary I 2 C port. The MPU-60X0 is footprint
compatible with the MPU-30X0 family.
The MPU-60X0 features three 16-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for digitizing the gyroscope outputs
and three 16-bit ADCs for digitizing the accelerometer outputs. For precision tracking of both fast and slow
motions, the parts feature a user-programmable gyroscope full-scale range of ±250, ±500, ±1000, and
±2000°/sec (dps) and a user-programmable accelerometer full-scale range of ±2g, ±4g, ±8g, and ±16g.
An on-chip 1024 Byte FIFO buffer helps lower system power consumption by allowing the system processor
to read the sensor data in bursts and then enter a low-power mode as the MPU collects more data. With all
the necessary on-chip processing and sensor components required to support many motion-based use
cases, the MPU-60X0 uniquely enables low-power MotionInterface applications in portable applications with
reduced processing requirements for the system processor. By providing an integrated MotionFusion output,
the DMP in the MPU-60X0 offloads the intensive MotionProcessing computation requirements from the
system processor, minimizing the need for frequent polling of the motion sensor output.
Communication with all registers of the device is performed using either I 2 C at 400kHz or SPI at 1MHz
(MPU-6000 only). For applications requiring faster communications, the sensor and interrupt registers may
be read using SPI at 20MHz (MPU-6000 only). Additional features include an embedded temperature sensor
and an on-chip oscillator with ±1% variation over the operating temperature range.
By leveraging its patented and volume-proven Nasiri-Fabrication platform, which integrates MEMS wafers
with companion CMOS electronics through wafer-level bonding, InvenSense has driven the MPU-60X0
package size down to a revolutionary footprint of 4x4x0.9mm (QFN), while providing the highest
performance, lowest noise, and the lowest cost semiconductor packaging required for handheld consumer
electronic devices. The part features a robust 10,000g shock tolerance, and has programmable low-pass
filters for the gyroscopes, accelerometers, and the on-chip temperature sensor.
For power supply flexibility, the MPU-60X0 operates from VDD power supply voltage range of 2.375V-3.46V.
Additionally, the MPU-6050 provides a VLOGIC reference pin (in addition to its analog supply pin: VDD),
which sets the logic levels of its I 2 C interface. The VLOGIC voltage may be 1.8V±5% or VDD.
The MPU-6000 and MPU-6050 are identical, except that the MPU-6050 supports the I 2 C serial interface only,
and has a separate VLOGIC reference pin. The MPU-6000 supports both I 2 C and SPI interfaces and has a
single supply pin, VDD, which is both the device’s logic reference supply and the analog supply for the part.

7.7 Three-Axis MEMS Gyroscope with 16-bit ADCs and Signal Conditioning
The MPU-60X0 consists of three independent vibratory MEMS rate gyroscopes, which detect rotation about
the X-, Y-, and Z- Axes. When the gyros are rotated about any of the sense axes, the Coriolis Effect causes
a vibration that is detected by a capacitive pickoff. The resulting signal is amplified, demodulated, and filtered
to produce a voltage that is proportional to the angular rate. This voltage is digitized using individual on-chip
16-bit Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) to sample each axis. The full-scale range of the gyro sensors
may be digitally programmed to ±250, ±500, ±1000, or ±2000 degrees per second (dps). The ADC sample
rate is programmable from 8,000 samples per second, down to 3.9 samples per second, and user-selectable
low-pass filters enable a wide range of cut-off frequencies.
7.8 Three-Axis MEMS Accelerometer with 16-bit ADCs and Signal Conditioning
The MPU-60X0’s 3-Axis accelerometer uses separate proof masses for each axis. Acceleration along a
particular axis induces displacement on the corresponding proof mass, and capacitive sensors detect the
displacement differentially. The MPU-60X0’s architecture reduces the accelerometers’ susceptibility to
fabrication variations as well as to thermal drift. When the device is placed on a flat surface, it will measure
0g on the X- and Y-axes and +1g on the Z-axis. The accelerometers’ scale factor is calibrated at the factory
and is nominally independent of supply voltage. Each sensor has a dedicated sigma-delta ADC for providing
digital outputs. The full scale range of the digital output can be adjusted to ±2g, ±4g, ±8g, or ±16g.
7.9 Digital Motion Processor
The embedded Digital Motion Processor (DMP) is located within the MPU-60X0 and offloads computation of
motion processing algorithms from the host processor. The DMP acquires data from accelerometers,
gyroscopes, and additional 3 rd party sensors such as magnetometers, and processes the data. The resulting
data can be read from the DMP’s registers, or can be buffered in a FIFO. The DMP has access to one of the
MPU’s external pins, which can be used for generating interrupts.
The purpose of the DMP is to offload both timing requirements and processing power from the host
processor. Typically, motion processing algorithms should be run at a high rate, often around 200Hz, in order
to provide accurate results with low latency. This is required even if the application updates at a much lower
rate; for example, a low power user interface may update as slowly as 5Hz, but the motion processing should
still run at 200Hz. The DMP can be used as a tool in order to minimize power, simplify timing, simplify the
software architecture, and save valuable MIPS on the host processor for use in the application.
7.10 Primary I 2 C and SPI Serial Communications Interfaces
The MPU-60X0 communicates to a system processor using either a SPI (MPU-6000 only) or an I 2 C serial
interface. The MPU-60X0 always acts as a slave when communicating to the system processor. The LSB of
the of the I 2 C slave address is set by pin 9 (AD0).
The logic levels for communications between the MPU-60X0 and its master are as follows:
 MPU-6000: The logic level for communications with the master is set by the voltage on VDD
 MPU-6050: The logic level for communications with the master is set by the voltage on VLOGIC
For further information regarding the logic levels of the MPU-6050, please refer to Section 10.

7.11 Auxiliary I 2 C Serial Interface
The MPU-60X0 has an auxiliary I 2 C bus for communicating to an off-chip 3-Axis digital output magnetometer
or other sensors. This bus has two operating modes:
 I 2 C Master Mode: The MPU-60X0 acts as a master to any external sensors connected to the
auxiliary I 2 C bus
 Pass-Through Mode: The MPU-60X0 directly connects the primary and auxiliary I 2 C buses together,
allowing the system processor to directly communicate with any external sensors.
Auxiliary I 2 C Bus Modes of Operation:
 I 2 C Master Mode: Allows the MPU-60X0 to directly access the data registers of external digital
sensors, such as a magnetometer. In this mode, the MPU-60X0 directly obtains data from auxiliary
sensors, allowing the on-chip DMP to generate sensor fusion data without intervention from the
system applications processor.
For example, In I 2 C Master mode, the MPU-60X0 can be configured to perform burst reads,
returning the following data from a magnetometer:
 X magnetometer data (2 bytes)
 Y magnetometer data (2 bytes)
 Z magnetometer data (2 bytes)
The I 2 C Master can be configured to read up to 24 bytes from up to 4 auxiliary sensors. A fifth sensor
can be configured to work single byte read/write mode.
 Pass-Through Mode: Allows an external system processor to act as master and directly
communicate to the external sensors connected to the auxiliary I 2 C bus pins (AUX_DA and
AUX_CL). In this mode, the auxiliary I 2 C bus control logic (3 rd party sensor interface block) of the
MPU-60X0 is disabled, and the auxiliary I 2 C pins AUX_DA and AUX_CL (Pins 6 and 7) are
connected to the main I 2 C bus (Pins 23 and 24) through analog switches.
Pass-Through Mode is useful for configuring the external sensors, or for keeping the MPU-60X0 in a
low-power mode when only the external sensors are used.
In Pass-Through Mode the system processor can still access MPU-60X0 data through the I 2 C
interface.
Auxiliary I 2 C Bus IO Logic Levels
 MPU-6000: The logic level of the auxiliary I 2 C bus is VDD
 MPU-6050: The logic level of the auxiliary I 2 C bus can be programmed to be either VDD or VLOGIC
For further information regarding the MPU-6050’s logic levels, please refer to Section 10.2.

7.12 Self-Test
Please refer to the MPU-6000/MPU-6050 Register Map and Register Descriptions document for more details
on self test.
Self-test allows for the testing of the mechanical and electrical portions of the sensors. The self-test for each
measurement axis can be activated by means of the gyroscope and accelerometer self-test registers
(registers 13 to 16).
When self-test is activated, the electronics cause the sensors to be actuated and produce an output signal.
The output signal is used to observe the self-test response.
The self-test response is defined as follows:
Self-test response = Sensor output with self-test enabled – Sensor output without self-test enabled
The self-test response for each accelerometer axis is defined in the accelerometer specification table
(Section 6.2), while that for each gyroscope axis is defined in the gyroscope specification table (Section 6.1).
When the value of the self-test response is within the min/max limits of the product specification, the part has
passed self test. When the self-test response exceeds the min/max values, the part is deemed to have failed
self-test. Code for operating self test code is included within the MotionApps software provided by
InvenSense.

7.13 MPU-60X0 Solution for 9-axis Sensor Fusion Using I 2 C Interface
In the figure below, the system processor is an I 2 C master to the MPU-60X0. In addition, the MPU-60X0 is an
I 2 C master to the optional external compass sensor. The MPU-60X0 has limited capabilities as an I 2 C
Master, and depends on the system processor to manage the initial configuration of any auxiliary sensors.
The MPU-60X0 has an interface bypass multiplexer, which connects the system processor I 2 C bus pins 23
and 24 (SDA and SCL) directly to the auxiliary sensor I 2 C bus pins 6 and 7 (AUX_DA and AUX_CL).
Once the auxiliary sensors have been configured by the system processor, the interface bypass multiplexer
should be disabled so that the MPU-60X0 auxiliary I 2 C master can take control of the sensor I 2 C bus and
gather data from the auxiliary sensors.
For further information regarding I 2 C master control, please refer to Section 10.

7.14 MPU-6000 Using SPI Interface
In the figure below, the system processor is an SPI master to the MPU-6000. Pins 8, 9, 23, and 24 are used
to support the /CS, SDO, SCLK, and SDI signals for SPI communications. Because these SPI pins are
shared with the I 2 C slave pins (9, 23 and 24), the system processor cannot access the auxiliary I 2 C bus
through the interface bypass multiplexer, which connects the processor I 2 C interface pins to the sensor I 2 C
interface pins.
Since the MPU-6000 has limited capabilities as an I 2 C Master, and depends on the system processor to
manage the initial configuration of any auxiliary sensors, another method must be used for programming the
sensors on the auxiliary sensor I 2 C bus pins 6 and 7 (AUX_DA and AUX_CL).
When using SPI communications between the MPU-6000 and the system processor, configuration of
devices on the auxiliary I 2 C sensor bus can be achieved by using I 2 C Slaves 0-4 to perform read and write
transactions on any device and register on the auxiliary I 2 C bus. The I 2 C Slave 4 interface can be used to
perform only single byte read and write transactions.
Once the external sensors have been configured, the MPU-6000 can perform single or multi-byte reads
using the sensor I 2 C bus. The read results from the Slave 0-3 controllers can be written to the FIFO buffer as
well as to the external sensor registers.
For further information regarding the control of the MPU-60X0’s auxiliary I 2 C interface, please refer to the
MPU-6000/MPU-6050 Register Map and Register Descriptions document.

7.15 Internal Clock Generation
The MPU-60X0 has a flexible clocking scheme, allowing a variety of internal or external clock sources to be
used for the internal synchronous circuitry. This synchronous circuitry includes the signal conditioning and
ADCs, the DMP, and various control circuits and registers. An on-chip PLL provides flexibility in the
allowable inputs for generating this clock.
Allowable internal sources for generating the internal clock are:
 An internal relaxation oscillator
 Any of the X, Y, or Z gyros (MEMS oscillators with a variation of ±1% over temperature)
Allowable external clocking sources are:
 32.768kHz square wave
 19.2MHz square wave
Selection of the source for generating the internal synchronous clock depends on the availability of external
sources and the requirements for power consumption and clock accuracy. These requirements will most
likely vary by mode of operation. For example, in one mode, where the biggest concern is power
consumption, the user may wish to operate the Digital Motion Processor of the MPU-60X0 to process
accelerometer data, while keeping the gyros off. In this case, the internal relaxation oscillator is a good clock
choice. However, in another mode, where the gyros are active, selecting the gyros as the clock source
provides for a more accurate clock source.
Clock accuracy is important, since timing errors directly affect the distance and angle calculations performed
by the Digital Motion Processor (and by extension, by any processor).
There are also start-up conditions to consider. When the MPU-60X0 first starts up, the device uses its
internal clock until programmed to operate from another source. This allows the user, for example, to wait
for the MEMS oscillators to stabilize before they are selected as the clock source.
7.16 Sensor Data Registers
The sensor data registers contain the latest gyro, accelerometer, auxiliary sensor, and temperature
measurement data. They are read-only registers, and are accessed via the serial interface. Data from these
registers may be read anytime. However, the interrupt function may be used to determine when new data is
available.
For a table of interrupt sources please refer to Section 8.
7.17 FIFO
The MPU-60X0 contains a 1024-byte FIFO register that is accessible via the Serial Interface. The FIFO
configuration register determines which data is written into the FIFO. Possible choices include gyro data,
accelerometer data, temperature readings, auxiliary sensor readings, and FSYNC input. A FIFO counter
keeps track of how many bytes of valid data are contained in the FIFO. The FIFO register supports burst
reads. The interrupt function may be used to determine when new data is available.
For further information regarding the FIFO, please refer to the MPU-6000/MPU-6050 Register Map and
Register Descriptions document.
7.18 Interrupts
Interrupt functionality is configured via the Interrupt Configuration register. Items that are configurable include
the INT pin configuration, the interrupt latching and clearing method, and triggers for the interrupt. Items that
can trigger an interrupt are (1) Clock generator locked to new reference oscillator (used when switching clock

sources); (2) new data is available to be read (from the FIFO and Data registers); (3) accelerometer event
interrupts; and (4) the MPU-60X0 did not receive an acknowledge from an auxiliary sensor on the secondary
I 2 C bus. The interrupt status can be read from the Interrupt Status register.
For further information regarding interrupts, please refer to the MPU-60X0 Register Map and Register
Descriptions document.
For information regarding the MPU-60X0’s accelerometer event interrupts, please refer to Section 8.
7.19 Digital-Output Temperature Sensor
An on-chip temperature sensor and ADC are used to measure the MPU-60X0 die temperature. The
readings from the ADC can be read from the FIFO or the Sensor Data registers.
7.20 Bias and LDO
The bias and LDO section generates the internal supply and the reference voltages and currents required by
the MPU-60X0. Its two inputs are an unregulated VDD of 2.375 to 3.46V and a VLOGIC logic reference
supply voltage of 1.71V to VDD (MPU-6050 only). The LDO output is bypassed by a capacitor at REGOUT.
For further details on the capacitor, please refer to the Bill of Materials for External Components (Section
7.3).
7.21 Charge Pump
An on-board charge pump generates the high voltage required for the MEMS oscillators. Its output is
bypassed by a capacitor at CPOUT. For further details on the capacitor, please refer to the Bill of Materials
for External Components (Section 7.3).

Note:
To prevent switching into I 2 C mode when using SPI (MPU-6000), the I 2 C interface should be disabled by
setting the I2C_IF_DIS configuration bit. Setting this bit should be performed immediately after waiting for the
time specified by the “Start-Up Time for Register Read/Write” in Section 6.3.
For further information regarding the I2C_IF_DIS bit, please refer to the MPU-6000/MPU-6050 Register Map
and Register Descriptions document.
9.2 I 2 C Interface
I 2 C is a two-wire interface comprised of the signals serial data (SDA) and serial clock (SCL). In general, the
lines are open-drain and bi-directional. In a generalized I 2 C interface implementation, attached devices can
be a master or a slave. The master device puts the slave address on the bus, and the slave device with the
matching address acknowledges the master.
The MPU-60X0 always operates as a slave device when communicating to the system processor, which thus
acts as the master. SDA and SCL lines typically need pull-up resistors to VDD. The maximum bus speed is
400 kHz.
The slave address of the MPU-60X0 is b110100X which is 7 bits long. The LSB bit of the 7 bit address is
determined by the logic level on pin AD0. This allows two MPU-60X0s to be connected to the same I 2 C bus.
When used in this configuration, the address of the one of the devices should be b1101000 (pin AD0 is logic
low) and the address of the other should be b1101001 (pin AD0 is logic high).

Communication on the I 2 C bus starts when the master puts the START condition (S) on the bus, which is
defined as a HIGH-to-LOW transition of the SDA line while SCL line is HIGH (see figure below). The bus is
considered to be busy until the master puts a STOP condition (P) on the bus, which is defined as a LOW to
HIGH transition on the SDA line while SCL is HIGH (see figure below).

Additionally, the bus remains busy if a repeated START (Sr) is generated instead of a STOP condition.

Data Format / Acknowledge
I 2 C data bytes are defined to be 8-bits long. There is no restriction to the number of bytes transmitted per
data transfer. Each byte transferred must be followed by an acknowledge (ACK) signal. The clock for the
acknowledge signal is generated by the master, while the receiver generates the actual acknowledge signal
by pulling down SDA and holding it low during the HIGH portion of the acknowledge clock pulse.
If a slave is busy and cannot transmit or receive another byte of data until some other task has been
performed, it can hold SCL LOW, thus forcing the master into a wait state. Normal data transfer resumes
when the slave is ready, and releases the clock line (refer to the following figure).

Communications
After beginning communications with the START condition (S), the master sends a 7-bit slave address
followed by an 8 th bit, the read/write bit. The read/write bit indicates whether the master is receiving data from
or is writing to the slave device. Then, the master releases the SDA line and waits for the acknowledge
signal (ACK) from the slave device. Each byte transferred must be followed by an acknowledge bit. To
acknowledge, the slave device pulls the SDA line LOW and keeps it LOW for the high period of the SCL line.
Data transmission is always terminated by the master with a STOP condition (P), thus freeing the
communications line. However, the master can generate a repeated START condition (Sr), and address
another slave without first generating a STOP condition (P). A LOW to HIGH transition on the SDA line while
SCL is HIGH defines the stop condition. All SDA changes should take place when SCL is low, with the
exception of start and stop conditions.

Complete I 2 C Data Transfer
To write the internal MPU-60X0 registers, the master transmits the start condition (S), followed by the I 2 C
address and the write bit (0). At the 9 th clock cycle (when the clock is high), the MPU-60X0 acknowledges the
transfer. Then the master puts the register address (RA) on the bus. After the MPU-60X0 acknowledges the
reception of the register address, the master puts the register data onto the bus. This is followed by the ACK
signal, and data transfer may be concluded by the stop condition (P). To write multiple bytes after the last
ACK signal, the master can continue outputting data rather than transmitting a stop signal. In this case, the
MPU-60X0 automatically increments the register address and loads the data to the appropriate register. The
following figures show single and two-byte write sequences.

To read the internal MPU-60X0 registers, the master sends a start condition, followed by the I 2 C address and
a write bit, and then the register address that is going to be read. Upon receiving the ACK signal from the
MPU-60X0, the master transmits a start signal followed by the slave address and read bit. As a result, the
MPU-60X0 sends an ACK signal and the data. The communication ends with a not acknowledge (NACK)
signal and a stop bit from master. The NACK condition is defined such that the SDA line remains high at the
9 th clock cycle. The following figures show single and two-byte read sequences.
