 never to love but once in my life and that another person was to have the first and last sighs of my heart since i had lived in the house of madam dupin i had always been sat isfied with my situation without showing the least sign of a desire to improve it the addition which in conjunction with m de francueil she had made to my salary was entirely of their own accord this year m de francueil whose friendship for me daily increased had it in his thoughts to place me more at ease and in a less precarious situation he was receiver general of finance m dudoyer his cash keeper was old and rich and wished to retire m de francueil offered me his place and to prepare myself for it i went during a few weeks to dudoyer to take the necessary instructions but whether my talents were ill suited to the em ployment or that m dudoyer who i thought wished to procure his place for another was not in earnest in the instructions he gave me i ac quired by slow degrees and very imperfectly the knowledge i was in want of and could never understand the nature of accounts rendered intricate perhaps designedly however without having possessed my self of the whole scope of the business i learned enough of the method to pursue it without the least difficulty i even entered on my new office i kept the cashbook and the cash i paid and received money took and gave receipts and although this business was so ill suited to my inclina tions as to my abilities maturity of years beginning to render me sedate i was determined to conquer my disgust and entirely devote myself to my new employment unfortunately for me i had no sooner begun to proceed without diffi culty than m de francueil took a little journey during which i remained intrusted with the cash ves my friends these hurt at seeing me walk alone in a new path while i seemed to take meas ures for my happiness used all their endeavors to render me ridiculous and that they might afterwards defame me first strove to make me con temptible it was less my literary fame than my personal reformation of which i here state the period that drew upon me their jealousy they per haps might have pardoned me for having distinguished myself in the art of writing but they could never forgive my setting them by my conduct an example which in their eyes seemed to reflect on themselves i was born for friendship my mind and easy disposition nourished it without difficulty as long as i lived unknown to the public i was beloved by all my private acquaintance and i had not a single enemy but the moment i acquired literary fame i had no longer a friend this was a great mis fortune but a still greater was that of being surrounded by people who called themselves my friends and used the rights attached to that sacred name to lead me on to destruction the succeeding part of these memoirs will explain this odious conspiracy i here speak of its origin and the manner of the first intrigue will shortly appear in the independence in which i lived it was however necessary to subsist to this effect i t
