holy in the course of a few days what af fected me most was that notwithstanding what i had heard of the anxious wish of the inhabitants to receive me amongst them i had not perceived as i passed through the streets anything polite towards me in their manners or obliging in their looks i was however determined to remain there but i learned saw and felt the day after that there was in the city a terrible fermentation of which i was the cause several persons hastened obligingly to inform me that on the next day i was to receive an order conceived in the most severe terms immediately to quit the state that is the city i had nobody in whom i could confide they who had de tained me were dispersed wildremet had disappeared i heard no more of barthes and it did not appear that his recommendation had brought me into great favor with those whom he had styled his patrons and fath ers one m de van travers a bernois who had an agreeable house not far from the city offered it to me for my asylum hoping as he said that i might there avoid being stoned the advantage this offer held out was not sufficiently flattering to tempt me to prolong my abode with these hospitable people yet having lost three days by the delay i had greatly exceeded the twenty four hours the bernois had given me to quit their states and knowing their severity i was not without apprehensions as to the man ner in which they would suffer me to cross them when the bailiff of nidau came opportunely and relieved me from my embarrassment as he had highly disapproved of the violent proceedings of their excellen cies he thought in his generosity he owed me some public proof of his taking no part in them and had courage to leave his bailiwick to come and pay me a visit at bienne he did me this favor the evening before my departure and far from being incognito he affected ceremony coming in fiocchi in his coach with his secretary and brought me a passport in his own name that i might cross the state of berne at my ease and without fear of molestation i was more flattered by the visit than by the passport and should have been as sensible of the merit of it had it had for object any other person whatsoever nothing makes a greater impression on my heart than a well timed act of courage in favor of the weak unjustly oppressed at length after having with difficulty procured a chaise i next morn ing left this barbarous country before the arrival of the deputation with which i was to be honored and even before i had seen theresa to whom i had written to come to me when i thought i should remain at bienne and whom i had scarcely time to countermand by a short letter inform ing her of my new disaster in the third part of my memoirs if ever i be able to write them i shall state in what manner thinking to set off for berlin i really took my departure for england and the means by which the two ladies who wished to dispose of my person after having by their manoeuvres driven me from switzerland where i was not sufficiently in their power at last delivered me into the hands of their friend i added what follows on reading my memoirs to m and madam the countess of egmont the prince pignatelli the marchioness of mesme and the marquis of juigne i have written the truth if any person has heard of things contrary to those i have just stated were they a thousand times proved he has heard calumny and falsehood and if he refuses thoroughly to examine and compare them with me whilst i am alive he is not a friend either to justice or truth for my part i openly and without the least fear declare that whoever even without having read my works shall have examined with his own eyes my disposition character manners inclinations pleasures and habits and pronounce me a dishonest man is himself one who deserves a gibbet
