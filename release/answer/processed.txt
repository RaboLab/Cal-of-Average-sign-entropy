worldwide as millions of people stay at home to minimise transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus health care workers prepare to do the exact opposite they will go to clinics and hospitals putting themselves at high risk from covid figures from china s national health commission show that more than health care workers have been infected as of early march and according to local media by the end of february at least had died in italy of responding health care workers were infected and some have died reports from medical staff describe physical and mental exhaustion the torment of difficult triage decisions and the pain of losing patients and colleagues all in addition to the infection risk as the pandemic accelerates access to personal protective equipment ppe for health workers is a key concern medical staff are prioritised in many countries but ppe shortages have been described in the most affected facilities some medical staff are waiting for equipment while already seeing patients who may be infected or are supplied with equipment that might not meet requirements alongside concerns for their personal safety health care workers are anxious about passing the infection to their families health care workers who care for elderly parents or young children will be drastically affected by school closures social distancing policies and disruption in the availability of food and other essentials health care systems globally could be operating at more than maximum capacity for many months but health care workers unlike ventilators or wards cannot be urgently manufactured or run at occupancy for long periods it is vital that governments see workers not simply as pawns to be deployed but as human individuals in the global response the safety of health care workers must be ensured adequate provision of ppe is just the first step other practical measures must be considered including cancelling non essential events to prioritise resources provision of food rest and family support and psychological support presently health care workers are every country s most valuable resource summary background we aimed to evaluate and improve the accuracy of the ultrasound scan in estimating gestational age in late pregnancy ie after weeks gestation in low income and middle income countries lmics where access to ultrasound in the first half of pregnancy is rare and where intrauterine growth restriction is prevalent methods this prospective population based cohort study was done in three lmics bangladesh pakistan and tanzania participating in the who alliance for maternal and newborn health improvement study women carrying a live singleton fetus dated by crown rump length crl measurements between weeks of gestation who were willing to return for two additional ultrasound scans and who planned on delivering in the study area were enrolled in the study participants underwent ultrasonography at weeks and at weeks gestation birthweights were measured within h of birth and the proportions of infants who had a small for gestational age birthweight ie a birthweight of the standard birthweight for the infant s gestational age and sex according to the intergrowth st project newborn baby reference standards and appropriate for gestational age birthweights were ascertained estimation of gestational age by standard fetal biometry measurements in addition to transcerebellar diameter tcd measurements was compared with gold standard crl measurements by use of bland altman plots to calculate the mean difference and limits of agreement statistical modelling was done to develop new gestational age prediction formulas for third trimester ultrasonography in lmics findings between feb and jan women were enrolled in the study pregnant women had an ultrasound scan at weeks of gestation and had an ultrasound scan between weeks of gestation of the unique infants whose birthweights were available infants were born with an appropriate for gestational age birthweight and infants were born with a small for gestational age birthweight the accuracy of late pregnancy ultrasound biometry using existing formulas to estimate gestational age in lmics was similar to that in high income settings with standard dating formulas late pregnancy ultrasound at weeks gestation was accurate to within approximately plus or minus weeks of the gold standard crl measurement of gestational age and late pregnancy ultrasound was accurate to within weeks of the crl measurement at weeks gestation in infants who were ultimately born small for gestational age individual parameters systematically underestimated gestational age apart from tcd which showed minimal bias by use of a novel parsimonious model formula that combined tcd with femur length gestational age at the week ultrasound scan was estimated to within days of the crl measurement and estimated to within days of the crl measurement at the week ultrasound scan similar results were observed in infants who were small for gestational age interpretation incorporation of tcd and the use of new formulas in late pregnancy ultrasound scans could improve the accuracy of gestational age estimation in both appropriate for gestational age and small for gestational age infants in lmics given the high rates of small for gestational age infants in lmics these results might be especially relevant validation of this new formula in other lmic populations is needed to establish whether the accuracy of the late pregnancy ultrasound can be narrowed to within approximately weeks funding bill melinda gates foundation view related content for this article research in context evidence before this study the performance of late pregnancy ultrasound for assessing gestational age has been understudied in low income and middle income countries lmics where access to ultrasound for gestational age dating early in pregnancy is rare and where a high proportion of infants are born small for gestational age in high income settings the transcerebellar diameter tcd has shown promise as a biometric parameter that is less affected by intrauterine growth restriction than standard ultrasound biometric measurements but this parameter is not routinely used as most women in high income settings present earlier weeks of gestation for ultrasound confirmation of gestational age added value of this study in this multicountry population based cohort study we compared the performance of standard ultrasound biometric parameters and tcd with the gold standard method of first trimester crown rump length crl measurements for estimating gestational age in late pregnancy ie after weeks gestation the accuracy of ultrasonography in estimating gestational age in late pregnancy in lmics was similar to that reported in high income settings but it was further improved when tcd was included in the combination formulas for gestational age assessment we derived a parsimonious model requiring measurement of only the tcd and the femur length that was accurate to within approximately plus or minus weeks of the gold standard crl measurement of gestational age even among infants who were ultimately born small for gestational age our study was population based enrolling an unselected group of pregnant women rather than a selected group of only the healthiest pregnant women therefore we believe our novel gestational age formula is more generalisable to real world conditions that health care practitioners in lmics face implications of all the available evidence in lmics gestational age in late pregnancy can be reliably assessed to within approximately weeks of the crl measurement by use of only two ultrasound parameters these results were consistent when our gestational age formulas were applied to pregnancies in which the infants were ultimately born small for gestational age our formulas could be most useful when measuring gestational age in pregnant women who present late to receive antenatal care in lmics where the burden of intrauterine growth restriction is high the biometric ultrasound measurements used in our study appear to be attainable by health care providers with limited sonography training accurate gestational age dating can enable providers to identify pregnancies requiring antenatal interventions such as corticosteroids or transfer to a facility that is able to handle premature infants accurate dating will also allow researchers to better estimate the global burden of preterm birth and intrauterine growth restriction introduction pregnancy dating is an essential component of antenatal care accurate estimation of gestational age is needed to optimise provision of obstetric interventions and delivery location for preterm births and it is also a prerequisite to identify and manage fetal growth abnormalities additionally accurate estimation of gestational age is required to provide reasonable global estimates of preterm birth and intrauterine growth restriction in low income and middle income countries lmics where the burden of preterm birth and intrauterine growth restriction is highest assessing gestational age accurately can be challenging because of many factors for instance last menstrual period is often unknown and menstrual cycles can vary in length symphysis fundal height can be a misleading measure of gestational age because of variation in maternal adiposity intrauterine growth restriction uterine fibroids or malpresentation the first trimester ultrasound is considered to be the gold standard method for estimating gestational age in high income settings but ultrasound early in gestation might not be routinely available in lmics in addition pregnant women in lmics might not present for antenatal care in early pregnancy as gestation advances ultrasound biometry becomes less accurate for estimating gestational age given the emergence of natural variation in fetal size and the possibility of pathological growth restriction indeed in lmics where of infants are born small for gestational age the assumption that fetal size predicts gestational age might not be valid studies suggest that measurements of the cerebellum could allow for a more accurate estimation of gestational age late in pregnancy ie from weeks gestation onwards compared with standard biometry measurements cerebellar size appears to be less affected by intrauterine growth restriction than other measures of growth there is also less natural variation in cerebellar size between fetuses transcerebellar diameter tcd nomograms have been published for several populations but they are not in mainstream use in high income settings as most women have early ultrasound scans at weeks gestation when standard biometric measurements biparietal diameter head circumference abdominal circumference and femur length are reported to provide an accurate estimation of gestational age to within plus or minus weeks of the gold standard crown rump length crl measurement of gestational age standard biometry does not perform as well in the third trimester as it does at less than weeks gestation with a reported accuracy of only or more weeks of the crl measurement one study in the usa found a strong correlation between cerebellar size and gestational age in infants born with an appropriate for gestational age birthweight and in those born small for gestational age even though a small number of studies have measured the cerebellum in specific lmics the performance of cerebellar biometry for assessing gestational age has been understudied in settings where its use might be of greater benefit the objective of the who alliance for maternal and newborn health improvement amanhi late pregnancy dating study was to evaluate the accuracy of late pregnancy ie after weeks gestation ultrasound biometry in estimating gestational age in lmic settings with a particular focus on the effect of intrauterine growth restriction on the accuracy and whether cerebellar measurements could improve performance methods study design and participants the who amanhi study cohort was established in to harmonise several large ongoing maternal and neonatal health research studies in sub saharan africa and south asia the study involved five distinct sites sylhet bangladesh karachi pakistan pemba tanzania brong ahafo gahna southern province zambia three of the five amanhi sites sylhet karachi and pemba participated in this prospective multicountry population based cohort substudy known as the who amanhi late pregnancy dating study the remaining two sites brong ahafo and the southern province were ineligible having completed amanhi enrolment amanhi study populations were predominantly rural with low levels of literacy as amanhi was an unselected population based cohort it was inclusive of both appropriately grown and growth restricted infants between feb and jan pregnant women were identified by trained field workers through home visits urine tests for human chorionic gonadotropin were used to confirm pregnancies women were eligible for the study if they were pregnant with a live singleton fetus the pregnancy had been dated by crl measurements between and weeks gestation crl of mm they were willing to return for two additional ultrasounds and they planned on delivering in the study area women pregnant with multiple fetuses or a non viable or anomalous fetus were ineligible fieldworkers obtained written informed consent from participants in their local languages and arranged study ultrasounds to coincide with standard amanhi visits ethics approval was granted by institutional review boards and ethics review committees in the participating countries the host institutions of principal investigators who and partners healthcare the boston based coordinating team procedures we considered the first trimester ultrasound scan to be the gold standard method for estimating gestational age amanhi study sonographers followed standardised procedures to obtain high quality transabdominal crl measurements three crl measurements were obtained for each participant and the median crl value and the intergrowth st equation were used to calculate gestational age first trimester crl measurements established the estimated date of delivery and were considered as the gold standard gestational age at all subsequent study visits study ultrasound procedures were standardised during a day training course in bangladesh for staff from participating amanhi sites and consisted of didactic and practical teaching methods competency was assessed with written and practical post training assessments staff from pakistan were unable to attend because of visa issues and they were therefore trained via skype conferencing no additional sonographers were recruited during the study period two ultrasound scans subsequent to the first trimester ultrasound were done for each participant the first between and weeks gestation and the second between and weeks gestation both coinciding with routine amanhi visits after study initiation the gestational age windows were extended to weeks and weeks to cover a wider range of the third trimester however only the pemba site received ethics approval for this extension before study completion at every ultrasound visit sonographers followed standardised procedures to obtain high quality measurements of the biparietal diameter head circumference abdominal circumference femur length and tcd appendix p sonographers were masked to the gold standard gestational age established by crl measurements ultrasound biometry measurements were obtained without the use of an automated biometry software package so that only absolute measurements were taken two measurements for each biometric parameter were obtained and averaged plausible measurement ranges were defined for each parameter before the analysis crl mm biparietal diameter cm head circumference cm femur length cm abdominal circumference cm and tcd cm for measures outside of these ranges data were checked for data entry errors and were assigned as missing if unresolved gestational age was calculated from each individual biometric parameter by use of standard tables hadlock and colleagues for biparietal diameter femur length and abdominal circumference chavez and colleagues for tcd and intergrowth st project for head circumference gestational age was also calculated by use of previously published formulas that combine more than one parameter hadlock and colleagues and intergrowth st project formulas and the reasonable ranges for individual parameters are detailed in the appendix p an image quality checklist provided objective guidance on appropriate image magnification ideal image plane and correct calliper placement all study images were reviewed by bjw who was masked to the gold standard gestational age values for ongoing quality control with quarterly feedback to the sonographers infants were visited within h of birth birthweights were obtained by use of digital scales small for gestational age was defined as less than of the standard birthweight for the infant s gestational age and sex according to the intergrowth st project newborn baby reference standards statistical analysis study sample size was calculated on the basis of our hypothesis that the gestational age agreement between tcd and crl would be higher than the agreement between standard biometry and crl both among infants with appropriate for gestational age birthweights and among those with small for gestational age birthweights previously published literature and professional society guidelines have shown that late pregnancy biometry combination formulas have a gestational age accuracy of within days of the gold standard first trimester crl measurements by use of overlapping bland altman plots to compare the degree of agreement between tcd versus crl with standard biometry versus crl a sample size of would be adequate to show a mean difference of and limits of agreement loa of within days tcd vs crl versus within days standard biometry vs crl of the crl estimated gestational age we aimed to enrol a minimum of infants with small for gestational age birthweights per site assuming that of infants would be small for gestational age and that of pregnant women would be lost to follow up at delivery we required infants per site therefore we had a conservative target of enrolling participants per study site the stata software programme statacorp stata statistical software release college station tx usa was used for all statistical analyses bland altman plots were used to assess the agreement between gestational age measured by gold standard crl and gestational age measured by late pregnancy ultrasound biometric parameters mean differences bias with cis and loa values were calculated for each comparison for ease of comparison an approximation of the degree of agreement was calculated as the midpoint between the unsigned loa values as an example if the loa was to days the approximation of agreement would be within days of the gestational age as determined by the gold standard first trimester crl measurement for individual biometric parameters or combinations of parameters with bias ie if the ci of the mean difference does not include the gestational age window agreement limits would be skewed in the direction of the bias for infants with available birthweights we stratified the results by infant size to compare the accuracy of late pregnancy biometry measures among infants with appropriate for gestational age birthweights and small for gestational age birthweights statistical modelling was used to develop novel equations to predict gestational age with late pregnancy biometric parameters as covariates generalised linear regression was done by use of the stata glm command accounting for clustering of multiple visits for a participant gold standard gestational age determination by crl measurement was the dependent variable covariates tested in the models included all late pregnancy biometric parameters measured biparietal diameter head circumference femur length abdominal circumference and tcd natural logarithms were used to transform continuous measures given non normal distributions models with individual and combinations of biometric parameters were tested given the performance of tcd as an individual parameter models including tcd as the main predictor were examined adding additional biometric parameters assessing for significance ie if the p value was and improvement in the adjusted r and determining the best fit model according to the akaike information criterion potential models were cross validated to compare the predictive accuracy of the different models and select biometric parameters to be included in the final model two methods were used to cross validate the models in the first method the study dataset was divided into five random subsamples one subsample was withheld and statistical models were generated with the remaining of the data the model was then used to predict gestational age in the withheld subsample and a standardised error term was calculated on the basis of the predicted gestational age calculated as observed gestational age predicted gestational age predicted gestational age this process was repeated with each successive withheld subsample and a summary measure of the prediction error was generated for the entire dataset the model with the lowest prediction error was selected as the final model in the second cross validation method the data from one study site were withheld and statistical models were generated with data from the remaining two sites the model was then fit and used to predict gestational age in the first site that had the data withheld this process was repeated twice and the standardised error was calculated role of the funding source the funder of the study had no role in the study design data collection data analysis data interpretation or writing of the report results between feb and jan pregnant women in three of the five amanhi study sites bangladesh pakistan and tanzania with documented crl assessments between and weeks gestation were enrolled in this late pregnancy ultrasound study of these women completed late pregnancy scans data from nine infants were excluded from the final analysis because of implausible dates that could not be reconciled eg date of birth before date of ultrasound or year of ultrasound or birth recorded incorrectly we determined a priori that a difference of greater than days between the gold standard crl measurement of gestational age and the gestational age predicted by late pregnancy biometry measurements was considered to be implausibly associated with the performance of the ultrasound three such extreme outliers were excluded at weeks gestation and an additional three were excluded at weeks gestation the final analysis included unique mothers of whom underwent an ultrasound scan between and weeks gestation in bangladesh in pakistan

formula combining tcd and femur length measurements showed little improvement in the accuracy of estimating gestational age when infants were stratified by birthweight appropriate for gestational age or small for gestational age compared with previous combination formulas improving estimations by only day table however from the ultrasound scan at weeks gestation the amanhi combination formula could more accurately predict gestational age for appropriate for gestational age infants and small for gestational age infants compared with the intergrowth st project combination formula narrowing the loa to approximately weeks and with minimal bias table discussion we have identified several key findings regarding the performance of ultrasound biometry in late pregnancy in a large cohort of pregnant women in three lmic settings first it was reassuring to verify that the accuracy of late pregnancy ultrasound for estimating gestational age in our study was similar to the reported results from higher income settings where sonographer training is lengthier and includes more practical training compared with sonographer training in lmic settings biometric parameters at weeks gestation and weeks gestation alone and in combination were accurate to within approximately weeks of the gold standard crl measurement of gestational age these results are consistent with previous reports of the performance of late pregnancy biometric parameters in our study the accuracy of gestational age dating with individual biometric parameters before weeks was reasonably good approximation days to days of the standard crl measurements improving even further approximation days when individual biometric parameters were combined according to previously published formulas later scans weeks had wider individual loas approximation days as hypothesised the tcd as a single biometric parameter had the narrowest loa approximation days and even outperformed the combination formulas slightly approximation days importantly tcd also performed quite well among infants who were ultimately born small for gestational age with an accuracy of approximately days of the crl measurement of gestational age at weeks and approximately days of the crl measurement at weeks with little bias mean difference of days at both gestational age windows in summary nomograms established for measuring cerebellar size in high resource settings appear to perform well in this lmic population given the initial results showing successful performance of tcd in estimating gestational age we combined tcd with standard biometric parameters and used statistical modelling to investigate the performance of different combination formulas in the lmic study sites where the prevalence of infants born small for gestational age is high our first model combining tcd with biparietal diameter femur length and abdominal circumference narrowed the loa across the two third trimester gestational age windows to less than weeks a second parsimonious model combining only tcd and femur length performed nearly as well as the first model with the added benefit of simplicity in the number of parameters included both the femur and the cerebellum are structures that are fairly easy to identify in addition the measurements of these parameters are linear and therefore require less skill in calliper placement than circumference measurements as evidenced by the observation that these measurements were obtained successfully in of ultrasound scans in our study when compared with other published combination formulas our amanhi parsimonious model formula had the narrowest loa the least bias and performed similarly among infants born appropriate for gestational age and small for gestational age in both gestational age windows as the amanhi formulas were derived from our study population it is not surprising that they performed well even after attempting to separate model development and validation through cross validation exercises our gestational age formulas should therefore be viewed as hypothesis generating and they should be validated in other lmic populations before they are used extensively it is important to emphasise that our study included an unselected and population based cohort from three lmics at the time of enrolment the cohort therefore reflects the range of morbidities associated with pregnancy maternal nutritional status and fetal sizes that would be encountered by a health care practitioner in similar settings our cohort contrasts those used in previous studies such as the intergrowth st project cohort that were designed to measure optimal fetal growth and enrolled only healthy low risk women who were less likely to carry a growth restricted fetus these differences might help to explain why our amanhi parsimonious model outperformed both the hadlock and intergrowth st project formulas among infants who were born small for gestational age even at weeks gestation the loa of our amanhi parsimonious formula was still within days of the crl measurement of gestational age and it performed similarly among infants born with small for gestational age approximation days or appropriate for gestational age approximation days birthweights an estimation of gestational age to within approximately weeks of the standard crl measurement is a remarkable achievement for lmic settings as many women do not have an ultrasonography in the first half of pregnancy if intrauterine growth restriction is suspected measurement of cerebellar size in the third trimester could help to confirm that this is the case our study has several strengths including its large sample size and the determination of gestational age by use of gold standard first trimester crl measurements that were verified by a multilayered quality control process nonetheless there are some limitations of our study we did not evaluate the feasibility of obtaining cerebellum measurements after weeks gestation with advancing gestation shadowing from the calcified skull might preclude the accurate measurement of the tcd margins limiting its use as the pregnancy nears full term the results shown in figure suggest that accurate tcd measurements might be more difficult to obtain as the pregnancy advances as several individual data points fell below the lower loa rather than the upper loa at the week gestational age window this underestimation of gestational age by tcd in this gestational age window could reflect difficulties in measuring the full size of the cerebellar hemispheres in summary if validated in other lmic populations our novel parsimonious model for estimating gestational age in late pregnancy could be useful for research public health surveillance and clinical care our study findings might be clinically relevant for health care providers tasked with determining whether a fetus is small rather than preterm and thus might limit iatrogenic harm from unnecessary preterm delivery two important messages can be concluded from our work first cerebellar measurements using previously established nomograms from high resource settings are a useful adjunct to late pregnancy biometry measurements in lmics where the burden of infants born small for gestational age is high secondly if validated in other lmic populations a parsimonious gestational age formula requiring measurement of only two biometric parameters might narrow accuracy of late pregnancy ultrasound to within approximately weeks contributors this manuscript is the
